			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p class="left">Children undergoing radiotherapy have to go through many experiences that range from uncomfortable to challenging, not just for the themselves but also for their families. This project studies the current situation in Swedish hospitals, and explores how a service designed around the current process can improve the overall experience. The final result a service called “Kompis” provides a companion in the form of a toy who helps the child through his journey, and enables the parents to support the child better.</p>

			<h1>Field Research Insights</h1>
			<p>A crucial part of our design process for designing an intricate service system which would compliment an existing medical process was ethnographic research. The research was carried out over a 3 day period and at three leading radio therapy institutions in Sweden, Norrlands Universitetssjukhus, Karolinska, and Akademiska. We were able to see if there were any commonalities or differences between the various pediatric oncology wards and most importantly the radiology departments and how the deal with child patients. We held interviews with staff and patients, photographed the environment, and observed from afar to gain insights and a baisic understanding on the Radio Therapy process.</p>

			<h1>Ideation</h1>
			<p>We had brainstorming sessions using service design cards, and also organised a workshop to come up with ideas. The workshop was with Masters students at the Design School, but we deliberately did not directly make references to our brief and problem area during the workshop. Our process was to generate a large number of ideas, evaluate them against our objectives and eliminate the ones that didn’t work well. This meant that we explored quite deep in two or three rather different areas before we decided on a final direction.</p>

					<p>Our view of “gaming” was rather broad. We explored various genres of games, and various types of gameplay, and various ways for the child and parent to become part of it. We studied games that would require varying degrees of involvement - from passive (take me on a ride) to active (complete objectives to proceed) to collaborative (parents help to complete objectives). We explored possibilities of staging the game in different locations: RT room, play room, hospital, school, home - including games that follow you wherever you go.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="theme_text">
					<strong>Children Younger Than 10 Years</strong>
					<p>Most concepts and procedures need to be explained using entertaining metaphors that children can relate to. This is the main group which needs help to undergo treatment without anaesthesia.</p>

			<div class="theme">

				</div>
				<div class="theme_text">
					<strong>Teenagers</strong>
					<p>Narrative is important. Engagement is important.
Playfulness and metaphors are not really necessary, but they help.
Older teenagers need support to deal with school, social life, friends. They need help to cope with side effects as part of their everyday life. Compared to problems associated with living with cancer, the experience of going through radiotherapy sessions is relatively easier. This group does not often require anaesthesia.</p>

				<div class="theme_text">
					<strong>Parents</strong>
					<p>Parents need a lot of direct information. They also need a platform or method to get answers on-the-spot to questions they might have while they’re at home. Narrative is still important when explaining medical procedures.</p>
<p>Parents will benefit from prepping from child psychologists. They need to ensure that their behaviour motivates the child and not introduce new fears or increase their anxiety.</p>

		<article>
			<h1>Focus Problem Areas</h1>
			<div class="left">
				<strong>Information Gaps</strong>
				<p>Each Radiology department has their own custom means of preparing the child patient for their radio therapy treatment. We identified "information" and how it is delivered as the most important issue to solve. The was a great lack of consistency across the hospitals as well varying amounts of details within the information delivered.</p>
				<strong>Loneliness</strong>
				<p>The child was not always allowed to be with either their family or friends and lacks a companion. The toys used in the play therapy are detached from the child and are only used as props to help the nurses explain exactly what will happen and when.</p>
				<strong>Neglected Parents</strong>
				<p>We learned that parents feel overwhelmed with the very direct information about Radio Therapy process and felt left out of the simple information being delivered to the child.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right">
				<strong>Misplaced Purpose</strong>
				<p>We identified that it was quite common for parents to personify the tumor as a "bad guy". Occasionally the child would assign a negative role towards the staff which was a hindrance in the staffs efforts to help them and be considered as positive assets to their treatment.</p>
				<strong>Misdirected Anxiety</strong>
				<p>The roles of the nurses and doctors needed more support to help provide the child and parents with an understanding that they are they to help. There was some areas of mistrust and even doubt which was present among the patient especially.</p>
				<strong>Gaps in Play Therapy</strong>
				<p>Currently toys which are used in play therapy to explain certain aspects of what will happen during the treatment are disconnected from the child. They are only used as props.</p>

			<h1>The Kompis Service</h1>
		</article>
			<div class="service_img"><img src="images/service1.jpg"/></div>
		<article>
			<div class="left">
				<strong>The Kompis Service</strong>
				<p>Kompis, in a sentence, provides the child with a companion to help him through his journey. Kompis as a service has three main components, the toy, the movies and the book, all tied together by a central component, which is the story.</p>
				<strong>The Toy</strong>
				<p>The Toy, or the Kompis, is the child’s companion through the cancer treatment. The child is introduced to the toy and its character at the beginning of the radiotherapy treatment. He gets to choose the toy, and then learns the toy’s story in two ways, through the BOOKS and the MOVIES.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right">
				<strong>The Story</strong>
				<p>The story of the Kompis is somewhat similar to the child’s own story. The main character or hero is a characterization of the child, and the Kompis’s journey is a representation of the child’s struggle with cancer and radiotherapy. The other characters in this story are depictions of the places, people, machines and experiences that the child will encounter, and these are presented to the child as friends, enemies and challenges which he and his Kompis have to face together. The purpose of the story is to ensure clarity in the roles of all the people and places in his journey, to help him understand that the machines are there for him, even though they look scary, and that doctors and nurses are on his side, even though they might be involved in uncomfortable procedures. The Kompis’s story illustrates these roles.</p>
			</div>
		</article>
		<div class="service_img"><img src="images/service2.jpg"/></div>
		<article>
			<div class="left">
				<strong>The Movies</strong>
				<p>The movies are a series of short (2 - 3 minute) clips that play out the story of the Kompis. These clips are played on four LCD screens, one each in the Play Room, CT Room, Fixation Room and Linear Accelerator Room. Each TV has an RFID reader hidden in a chair next to it. Whenever the child enters one of these rooms, he is invited to place his toy (or bring it near) this chair. The toy itself contains an RFID chip which identifies the child. When the child puts the toy on the chair, the chip is “read” and the TV starts to play a movie clip corresponding to a particular chapter in the Kompis’s story. These movie clips are streamed to the TV from a central server. The movie clip is unique to the child because it is customized for his own toy, his own particular case of cancer, and his own treatment plan (so that the server knows which clip to play at what time).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right">
				<strong>The Book</strong>
				<p>The story of the Kompis which is shown to the child in movie form is also given to the family as a book. At home, the child gets to catch up on the story, on parts that he might have missed in the movie, and he gets to learn more about the characters in the movie and their back stories. The book is also customized according to the toy that the child chooses at the start of his or her treatment. Parents are encouraged to read to their children, and make the story their own, with special references to their particular situation. The book contains activities that help the child practise wearing the mask, lying still and getting used to procedures and equipment. The child, his parents, sibling all take part in these activities together. As the treatment progresses, the child and Kompis make “achievements” in passing certain stages, and he is rewarded for these achievements with stickers or stars. The child gets these stickers from the nurse in the hospital and adds them to his book.</p>

		<article>
			<h1>Support Technology</h1>
			<div class="left">
				<p>The technology and hardware required for Kompis to function is very low tech and affordable.</p>
				<p>
					Kompis Requires the following:
					<ul>
						<li>A TV with speakers in each room, four suggested rooms are the play room, CT room, Fixation room and Linear Accelerator Room</li>
						<li>RFID readers where the child docks his Kompis</li>
						<li>RFID Tags in each Kompis toy</li>
						<li>Stuffed Animals, the toys to play the role of the Kompis</li>
						<li>Central Hard drive connected to a network</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right">
				<p>We decided to use RFID tags within the toys so that there is no information stored in the Kompis which could be damaged though wear and tear and radiation. Also the tags can be placed within any other object for another child. This also allows the child to use the toy or whatever has an RFID tag within it as a check in system which is very discreet.</p>
				<p>The Animations would be played on the TV screens installed in each section of Radiology. As the RFID tag is placed or swiped across the RFID reader this will then trigger the appropriate animation for that stage of the service. The animations are stored on the network hard drive and the TVs access it via WIFI or LAN cable.</p>

			<h1>Service Benefits</h1>
			<div class="left">
				<strong>Clear Information</strong>
				<p>We wanted to provide a more consistent delivery of information. Kompis delivers information in a friendly and easy manner which aims at providing different styles of information depending on ages and if it is to the parents.</p>
				<strong>Companion</strong>
				<p>Kompis is a toy which can accompany the child where no man can go and provide comfort for them. Also it can be taken home and be his personal companion during and post the treatment.</p>
				<strong>Personified Concepts</strong>
				<p>Kompis Introduces a mandatory personification and metaphorical narrative to the patients about the radio therapy process. The cancer is now the “bad guy” and this process is about defeating the “bad guy” with the Kompis characters. Also, the Kompis service will make sure that this new narrative and delivery of information will be balanced with the “good guys” such as the equipment and staff.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right">
				<strong>Clarity in Roles</strong>
				<p>Kompis supports the roles of the nurses and doctors by illustrating ,through the various touch points on which animations are played, that the staff an equipment are there to help you have a successful and fluid journey during Radio Therapy.</p>
				<strong>Involved Parents</strong>
				<p>From the ethnographic research we learned that parents feel overwhelmed with the very direct information about Radio Therapy process. With this service they are now able to learn by explaining to the child which an exercise and information book which is provided at the beginning of the treatment. This book also will encourage a bonding experience with the child during treatment.</p>
				<strong>Toys: Play Therapy</strong>
				<p>With Kompis’s selection of RFID toys, which can be used to watch informative animations, the patient has his own companion throughout his whole treatment.</p>
			</div>
		</article>
		<div class="next_img"><img src="images/photo.jpg"/></div>
		<article>
			<h1>Potential Directions</h1>
			<div class="left">
				<strong>Potential direction for the service</strong>
				<p>Although this service has been built around and focuses on children from the age of 3 to 8 it is possible to scale the technology to suit the needs of older children, teenagers and possibly adults. The RFID tag system, with the readers and tags, can be used by teenagers to trigger and play their preferred music or videos which they have preselected. This content could easily be accessed from Spotify or video networks such as YouTube and Vimeo.</p>
				<p>Also with the flexibility of the RFID system we could incorporate any toy a child brings into an animation and bring it to life and further enhance their experience during their Radio Therapy.</p>
				<strong>Feedback from staff</strong>
				<p>The simplicity as well as the possibility to deploy it quickly was a common comment made on Kompis. Also the idea of providing the child with an accomplice which he can bond with as well as one which can be used to help the staff explain and narrate the Radio Therapy process was greatly appreciated and felt as a important asset to bring into the patient journey. The penguin was cute.</p>
				<p>Although Kopmis asks for an arrangement of several characters which could be chosen by the child to allow for some diversity, it was stated that maybe it could be streamlined even more to just one Kompis, i.e. the Penguin and his story. This would increase the chance of the deployment of Kompis and also save time on creating extra animations for the different characters ( lion, bear, etc...)</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right">
				<strong>Reflections</strong>
				<p>Kompis had to address a very specific and difficult brief with several restraints As we were aiming to ameliorate a medical procedure, the existing patient journey / service is 90 - 95% is unable to altered and very difficult to introduce new elements into this medical environment. As
well as working around the medical flow Kompis had to approach tight boundaries in medical procedures, ethics, and practicality of the service, i.e. was it possible to deploy the interventions contained within the service without infringing on any of the briefs restrictions.</p>
				<p>We felt we addressed the main goal of the brief, reduce and/or prevent the need for anesthesia during Radio Therapy, to a high standard with a simple solution applying both analogue and digital technologies.</p>
